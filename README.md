# First-Time Home Buyer Calculator

## App Summary
This web app helps first-time home buyers quickly estimate monthly home costs and understand tradeoffs like loan terms and down payment size. The primary user is a first-time buyer who wants simple, honest guidance without needing a spreadsheet. The product presents key inputs (home price, income, down payment, rate, term) and displays an estimated monthly payment breakdown. It also compares loan terms to help users understand total interest and monthly affordability. Our current milestone focuses on setting up the project repo and frontend scaffold, then building the backend + database vertical slice in upcoming milestones.
